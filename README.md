# 🛡️ Dispute & Chargeback Response Kit

**Stop losing money to chargebacks.** This skill turns your AI assistant into a chargeback-fighting machine — it knows every reason code, what evidence you need, and drafts your response for you.

## The Problem

You get a chargeback notification. You have 7-21 days to respond. Most clinic owners either:
- Panic and accept the loss
- Submit weak evidence and lose anyway
- Miss the deadline entirely

**Average chargeback win rate: 30%.** With the right evidence and response? **60-80%.**

## What This Does

Tell your AI: *"I got a $2,500 chargeback on Stripe, customer says unauthorized"*

It will:
1. **Identify the reason code** and what it actually means
2. **Generate your evidence checklist** — exactly what screenshots, logs, and docs you need
3. **Draft your response letter** using our proven template (same one we use internally)
4. **Tell you where and how to submit** with platform-specific steps and deadlines
