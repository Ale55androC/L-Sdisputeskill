## Universal Best Practices

1. **Compile evidence as a single PDF** when possible — organized, professional
2. **Include a cover letter** summarizing the case (use response templates)
3. **Timestamp everything** — screenshots should show dates
4. **Highlight key evidence** — don't make the reviewer search for it
5. **Keep it concise** — 5-10 pages max, not a novel
6. **Never include sensitive card data** in evidence submissions
